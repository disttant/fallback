## Preparing

## Installing for production

#### 1. The hard way

0. Install PHP, PHP extensions, Composer, Git
1. Clone the repository to a temporary folder
2. Copy composer.json and composer.lock to the final location
3. Go to that folder: 
```
cd /final/location
```
4. Execute: 
```
composer install --no-dev --no-scripts
```
5. Move the temporary folder's content to the final location
6. Re-build the autoload file executing: 
```
composer dump-autoload
```
7. Configure *.env* file
8. Create your DB tables executing: 
```
php artisan migrate
```
9. Give the right permissions to the files: 
```
find /final/location -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
find /final/location -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
```
10. Configure the web server (like Nginx) to route all the requests 
to public/index.php



#### 2. The easy way (testing mode)
```
0. Install Docker
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the image with the Dockerfile included
3. Upload the image to a repository
4. Use the image with Compose or Kubernetes
   * Set all the environment variables Laravel uses
     + APP_VENDOR
     + APP_NAME
     + [...]

   * Mount /var/www in a volume
   * Mount /var/www/storage into a volume
```

Now, your container is listening on port 9000 (PHP_FPM)


You just must configure an NGINX container in the way 
Laravel documentation explains to use the app
